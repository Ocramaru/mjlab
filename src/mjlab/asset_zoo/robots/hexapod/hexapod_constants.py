"""Freenove Big Hexapod Kit constants.

Geometry is measured from the manufacturer's STEP assembly; see the header of
``xmls/hexapod.xml`` and ``tests/test_hexapod_geometry.py`` for provenance.

Actuators are MG995 hobby servos (18 of them, three per leg).  Unlike the
BLDC actuators on the Unitree robots, these are closed-loop position servos
with an internal controller we cannot see, so the stiffness and damping below
are a model of the servo's behaviour rather than a physical property.
